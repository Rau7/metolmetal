            When I was a developer, I often had a hundred questions when
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-500 leading-loose">
            These types of questions led me to miss numerous deadlines, and I
            wasted time and energy in back-and-forth communication. Sadly, this
            situation could have been avoided if the wireframes had provided
            enough detail.

            Now that I am a UX designer, I notice that some designers tend to
            forget that wireframes are equally creative and technical. We are
            responsible for designing great ideas, but we are also responsible
            for creating product specifications. I admit that there can be so
            many details to remember that itâ€™s easy to lose track. To save time
            and energy for myself, I gathered all of my years of wireframing
            knowledge into a single checklist that I refer to throughout the
            process. And now I am sharing this knowledge with you, so that you
            can get back to being creative.
